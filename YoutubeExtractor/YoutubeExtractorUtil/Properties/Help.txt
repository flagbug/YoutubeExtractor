Usage:
======

YoutubeExtractorUtil <link1> <link2> <link3...> [/LinksFile | /LinksFile=<"my links file.txt">] [/Destination=<"my download folder">] [/MinResolution=<n>] [/MaxResolution=<n>] [/IdealResolution=<n>] [/ExtractAudio | /ExtractAudio=<true | false>] [/VideoTypes=<type1,type2,type3...>]


Optional Parameters:
====================

One or multiple links can be listed in the command line.

/LinksFile
Using this switch alone indicates to read additional source links from the default file "LinksFile.txt".

/LinksFile=<"my links file.txt">
Parameterizing the switch indicates to read additional source links from the specified file instead: "my links file.txt".

/Destination=<"my download folder">
Specifies the location where downloaded and extracted files should be placed. You can use absolute paths pr paths relative to the current directory.

/MinResolution=<n>
/MaxResolution=<n>
These two switches allow you to specify a range of video resolutions that should be considered for download. 
If what's available on youtube is outside of this range then no video will be selected for download.

/IdealResolution=<n>
By default the highest resolution available is selected for download. This switch allow you to specify the preferred resolution (which may or may not be lower than the highest available one).
If the preferred resolution is not available, then the highest one will be chosen.
Specifying an ideal resolution that's outside of the range above will simply cause it to be ignored.

/ExtractAudio
This swith alone specifies that autio should be extracted. By default, audio is not extracted.

/ExtractAudio=true
This specifies the same thing.

/ExtractAudio=false
This specifies to not extract audio, but since that's the default anyway, specifying this in the command line is redundant (although harmless).
Sometimes it's simpler to write scripts that pass either true or false without having to consider what the default value is.

/VideoTypes=<type1,type2,type3...>
When present, this switch specifies a comma-delimited list of acceptable file formats. Any video formats not in the list are excluded in the selection process.
It also specifies the order of preference in which the acceptable types should be considered for selection.
Only one type will eventually be selected for download.
The full list of video types is: Mp4,Flash,WebM,Mobile,Unknown
The list must be compact as shown above and cannot contain any spaces (beforeor after the commas).
Limiting the list of acceptable file formats using this switch can of course in some cases cause 0 (zero) file format to be selected and therefore the video will not be downloaded.


Example:
========

YoutubeExtractorUtil http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3UBOOZw-FE /IdealResolution=1080 /ExtractAudio /Destination=.

Downloads 1080p video from the specified link. The downloads .flv file, extracts .mp3 from it and deletes the .flv file. 
Both "KOLLEGAH - Alpha (Official HD Video).mp4" and "KOLLEGAH - Alpha (Official HD Video).mp3" are placed in the current directory.
Even though there is a 1440p download available for the same video, 1080p is chosen instead.
